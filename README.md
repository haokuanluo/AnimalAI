There are two different approaches we tried:

RL based approach and planning based approach.

RL based approach can be found at examples/share_parameter_curiosity.py.

I used A3C based PPO with curiosity. 

Planning based approach can be found at examples/hardcode.

The detailed explanation of the planning based approach can be found here (in Chinese):
